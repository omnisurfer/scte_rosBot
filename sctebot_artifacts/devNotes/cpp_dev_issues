Note that if you source the ROS workspace, any cpp libraries you link to will be pointed towards the library version FIRST.
This can result in symbol link errors at run time including within the IDE. Need to figure out a way to work on the cpp
libraries (.so) without having to jump through hoops. Basically, DO NOT SOURCE THE ROS WORKSPACE WHEN USING THE IDE.
