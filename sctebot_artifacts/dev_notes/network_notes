- Remember to set ROS_MASTER_URI on all nodes including the master node. It uses this variable to tell the other nodes
where to connect to roscore.

- Remember to not set a gateway on the DHCP server that is hosted on the rosnode node. This should allow the rospi node
to connect to my router as a gateway to route traffic while still routing traffic between the nodes.
